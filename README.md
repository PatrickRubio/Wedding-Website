## Wedding Website Project
HTML | CSS | JavaScript | AWS Amplify | AWS Lambda | API Gateway | Route 53 | DynamoDB | IAM

This is the official code repository for the wedding website of myself and my wife Brianna. The website is hosted using AWS Amplify and integrates multiple AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, Route 53, DynamoDB, and IAM for secure backend operations. Designed to provide RSVP functionality and event information, it demonstrates full-stack web development and cloud deployment.
